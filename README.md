I found the following errors:
1)There should be colon after "def find_cube_pairs(target)" like "def find_cube_pairs(target):".
2)The operator for exponent is given wrong(***) in the lines 3,7. It  should instead be "**".
3)There should be colon after for statement in the lines 5,6 and 13. 
4)"sol" should be replaced with "solutions" in the lines 8 and 9.
5)"targ" should be replacd by "target" in the lines 3 and 7. 
6) "printf" should be replaced by "print" in the lines 12 and 14.
7)"pair" should be replaced by "pairs" in the line 13.
8)"," should be removed from the end of the lines 11 and 12.
9)Remove semicolon at the end of the lines 2 and 8.
10)Change "ranges" to "range"in lines 2 and 5.
11)Change to 2 to 3 in line14.
